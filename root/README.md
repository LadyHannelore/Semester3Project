**All classroom allocation, visualization, and reporting in this web interface is powered by the genetic algorithm implemented in [`ga.py`](../main/ga.py).**

This folder (`main/`) contains the web-based admin dashboard and user interface for the ClassForge project. It provides interactive tools for uploading data, running allocation algorithms, exploring students and classes, visualizing results, comparing models, making manual overrides, adjusting settings, and exporting reports.

## Model Used

**Note:** The classroom allocation and results shown in this web interface are powered by the genetic algorithm implemented in [`ga.py`](../main/ga.py). All allocation, visualization, and reporting features are based on the output of this genetic algorithm.

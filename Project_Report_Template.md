## Guidance on Using Your Project Files for the Report

*(This section provides advice on how to leverage your existing project files to gather information for your report. Refer to your project's root folder: c:\Users\umer_\Documents\GitHub\Semester3Project)*

### Python Code:

*   **`ga.py`**: This Python file likely contains core logic for your project, possibly related to a genetic algorithm or other backend processes. This will be crucial for the "Software Design Implementation" section.

### Web-related Code (HTML, JavaScript, CSS):

These files suggest a web-based application or interface. They are all relevant for the "Software Design Implementation" part of your report.

*   **General/Core Web Files:**
    *   `index.html`: Main entry point or homepage.
    *   `script.js`: General JavaScript for shared functions or core client-side logic.
    *   `styles.css`: General CSS for styling shared across multiple pages.
*   **Feature-specific Web Files:**
    *   `allocation.html`, `allocation.js`, `allocation.css`: Relate to an "allocation" feature.
    *   `classroom.html`, `classroom.js`, `classroom.css`: Relate to a "classroom" feature.
    *   `dashboard.css`: Styles a dashboard component.
    *   `overrides.html`, `overrides.js`, `overrides.css`: Custom modifications or specific overrides.
    *   `settings.html`, `settings.js`, `settings.css`: Manage a "settings" feature or page.
    *   `student-explorer.html`, `student-explorer.js`, `student-explorer.css`: For a "student explorer" feature.
    *   `upload.html`, `upload.js`, `upload.css`: Handle "upload" functionality.

### Other Important Files in the Root Folder for Context:

While not strictly "code" files, the following files in your root directory will be very helpful for other sections of your report, such as "Introduction," "Project topic background and motivations," and "Problem statement":

*   `README.md`: Contains a general overview, setup instructions, and potentially the project's purpose and motivation.
*   `Sem_Presentation_G11.pptx`: PowerPoint presentation likely summarizing your project's goals, design, and outcomes.
*   `synthetic_student_data_1000.csv` and `synthetic_student_data.csv`: Data files used by your project. Understanding this data is important for describing context and functionality.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies, relevant for describing the software environment.

### How to Use These Files for Your Report:

*   **Review `ga.py`**: Understand and document its algorithms, logic, and contribution to project functionality.
*   **Examine HTML, JS, and CSS files**: Understand the structure, behavior, and appearance of UI components.
*   **Use `README.md` and `Sem_Presentation_G11.pptx`**: Help write introductory and background sections.
*   **Refer to `.csv` files**: Explain the project's application or testing.

By examining these files, you should be able to gather the necessary information to detail your project's design and implementation.

## 5. Next Steps

To continue improving the project:
1. Update JavaScript imports in HTML files to reflect new paths
2. Set up proper testing with pytest for the backend
3. Add CI/CD configuration for automated testing
4. Implement proper error handling and logging
5. Add database integration for persistent storage
